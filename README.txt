In this work, we address those weaknesses by enhancing RC4 with a dynamic key generation mechanism. Rather than relying on static keys, we introduce a multisource entropy model using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), a Non-Linear Feedback Shift Register (NLFSR), and a lightweight hash function inspired by the Speck cipher. This approach ensures that the cipherâ€™s internal state evolves continuously, making it far moreresistant to prediction and reverse engineering.
